create an arrrayList constructur to recieve user data
create a method to document the users account and save it in a file

so far Everything is working the way it is suppose to do not delete code just because you can't
remember what it is for. I promise you it is being used for something.

all that is left to do is to build the withdrawal and deposit feature as well as the feature that tracks and reports
the users transactions.GOOD LUCK!:).
